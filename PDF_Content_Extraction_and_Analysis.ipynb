            "popularized in 1981 by Henri Holec in his seminal report for the Council of Europe \n",
            "entitled Autonomy in Foreign Language Learning  in which the researcher defined \n",
            "autonomy in the context of language learning as “the ability to take charge of one’s own \n",
            "learning” (Holec, 1981, p. 3). Holec’s idea of autonomy encompasses some components \n",
            "and capacities o n the part of language learners (e.g. self -directed learning). For some \n",

            "control of one’s own learning” (Benson, 2001, p. 46). As stated by Benson (2011, p. \n",
            "16), “autonomy is multidimensional and takes many different forms according to the \n",
            "person, the setting, and multiple contextual and micro -contextual factors” and it is “a \n",

            "roots are based in political, societal and educational developments. In addition to this, \n",
            "work on autonomy emphasizes social dimensions of learner autonomy in view of the \n",
            "fact that “autonomous learners always do things for themselves, but they may or may \n",
            "not do things on their own” (Little, 2009, p. 223) and that by means of social \n",
            "interactions language learners “develop a capacity to analyze, reflect upon and \n",
            "synthesize information to create new perspectives” (Lee, 2011, p. 88). It should also be \n",

            "matter of individualizing learning through out -of-class initiatives since the dominance of \n",
            "classroom-based approaches (Benson, 2011). Finally, it has to be added that \n",

            "Perhaps in order to define the concept of autonomy in language learning it is necessary \n",
            "to understand who au tonomous learners are. As Littlewood (1996) claims, an \n",
            "autonomous learner is “one who has independent capacity to make and carry out \n",
            "choices which govern his or her actions” (p. 428). The researcher argues that this \n",
            "capacity depends on two major components  such as ability and willingness, and he \n",
            "claims that the attributes can also be further subdivided. Thus, ability depends on \n",
            "having knowledge about the options from which one can choose and skills so as to \n",
            "choose the most suitable alternatives. When it com es to willingness, this depends on \n",
